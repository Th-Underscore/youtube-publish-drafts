## About
Automatically publish all your draft videos using JavaScript!

## How to Use This
(if you were to do that, which I'm pretty sure is against YouTube's Terms of Service, so don't do that)

1. Go to YouTube Studio's "Content"  page
2. Press F12
3. Paste the entire content of the [`youtube-publish-drafts.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Th-Underscore/youtube-publish-drafts/refs/heads/master/youtube-publish-drafts.js) file into Console
4. Make any necessary edits at the top marked "CONFIG", and press Enter
5. Get a snack! It might take a couple minutes
