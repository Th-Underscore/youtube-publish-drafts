## About
Automatically publish all your draft videos using JavaScript!

## How to Use This
(if you were to do that, which I'm pretty sure is against YouTube's Terms of Service, so don't do that)

1. Go to YouTube Studio's "Content"  page
2. Press F12 (or Ctrl+Shift+I, or right-click and select "Inspect" / "Inspect Element")
3. Paste the entire content of the [`youtube-publish-drafts.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Th-Underscore/youtube-publish-drafts/refs/heads/master/youtube-publish-drafts.js) file into the Console input
4. Make any necessary edits at the top of the text - marked `PUBLISH CONFIG` (visibility/schedule, made for kids, etc.) - and press Enter
5. Get a snack! This might take a couple minutes
